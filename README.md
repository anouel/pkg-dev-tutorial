## Feedback and communication

*will we do gitter?*
<https://gitter.im/what-they-forgot/wtf-2019-rsc> is our chat room. Good for live chat during the workshop. Feel free to ignore if you are overstimulated already.

[Issues](https://github.com/OWNER/pkg-dev-tutorial/issues) <-- all are encouraged to open issues as we go. This is actually tremendously helpful to us! Examples of issue-worthy thoughts:

  * Glitches in the instructions or materials that we need to fix, for current tutorial or future
  * Missing content that we identify
  * Great questions or sidebar discussions that we should consider formalizing and recording
  * Questions that are too specific or technical to answer in real-time
